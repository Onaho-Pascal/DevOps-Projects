## Bash Scripting
Your company has employed many new developers. As a SysOps engineer, write a bash script called create_users.sh that reads a text file containing the employeeâ€™s usernames and group names, where each line is formatted as user;groups.

The script should create users and groups as specified, set up home directories with appropriate permissions and ownership, generate random passwords for the users, and log all actions to /var/log/user_management.log. Additionally, store the generated passwords securely in /var/secure/user_passwords.txt.

Ensure error handling for scenarios like existing users and provide clear documentation and comments within the script.
Requirements:
- Each User must have a personal group with the same group name as the username, this group name will not be written in the text file.
- A user can have multiple groups, each group delimited by comma ","
- Usernames and user groups are separated by semicolon ";"- Ignore whitespace
e.g.
light; sudo,dev,www-data
idimma; sudo
mayowa; dev,www-datalml
For the first line, light is username and groups are sudo, dev, www-data
